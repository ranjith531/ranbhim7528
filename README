Hi, my name is Bhimagani Ranjith and I recently completed a weather reporting project using HTML, CSS, and JS.
The project involved creating a web page that displays real-time weather information for a specific location.

I am happy to explain my weather reporting project briefly using HTML, CSS, and JS.

My weather reporting project likely involved creating a web page that displays real-time weather information for a specific location.

HTML: The HTML portion of the project would likely involve creating the basic structure of the web page.
I have used HTML tags to define the different sections of the page, such as the header, navigation bar, and main content area. 
Within the main content area,I displayed the weather data, such as the current temperature, humidity,pressure and wind speed.

CSS: The CSS portion of the project would involve styling the web page to make it visually appealing and easy to read.
I haveused CSS to define the fonts, colors, and layout of the page.
I have also used CSS to create animations or transitions that make the weather information more engaging.

JS: The JS portion of the project would involve adding interactivity to the web page. 
I have used JavaScript to fetch the weather data from an API, such as OpenWeatherMap, and update the web page with the latest information.
I have also used JavaScript to add features such as search functionality, allowing users to enter a location and see the weather data for that area.

Overall, your weather reporting project would have combined HTML, CSS, and JS to create a dynamic and engaging web page that provides real-time weather information to users.
